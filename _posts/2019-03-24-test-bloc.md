In my [previous article](https://www.davidanaya.io/2019/test-http-requests-flutter) I explained how to unit test a set of use cases in Flutter for a provider used to do http requests.

Here I’d like to show a different scenario where I implement one of the core parts in any app: the state. There are multiple ways to manage state in a Flutter application, but I specially like [BLoC](https://www.davidanaya.io/2018/bloc), so I’ll use this one for my testing example.

## The BLoC

Following the example with the http provider from my previous article, here I have a BLoC which handles an `Identity` for a user. The requirements for our `IdentityBloc` are the following:

- Expose the current Identity with a Stream.
- Allows to set a new Identity with a Sink.
- Every time a new Identity is set, persist the value in the internal device storage.
- On initialization (when the app is open), load the current Identity from the internal device storage.

## The code

These are all the classes that we are going to use in the implementation. We will test only `IdentityBloc`, everything else we will need to mock.

![test-bloc](/contents/images/test-bloc/design.png)

For the device storage solution I will use the [shared_preferences](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/shared_preferences) library by Flutter Team with a simple wrapper on top of that to abstract some complexity from my BLoC. As I want my BLoC to depend on [abstractions and not on implementations](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#toc-dependency-inversion-principle), I also created an abstract class _StorageProvider_ which will be implemented by the real storage (out of the scope of this article).

```dart
abstract class StorageProvider {
  Future<bool> setMap(String key, Map<String, dynamic> value);

  Future<bool> setString(String key, String value);

  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getMap(String key);

  Future<String> getString(String key);
}
```

An `Identity` is basically an `id` and some extra information. As I will need to save and read from a storage, I will use `toJson()` and `fromJson()` to serialize my data. Also I anticipate the need to have an empty `Identity`, hence the named `empty()` constructor.

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class Identity {
  final String token;
  final String refreshToken;
  final String uid;

  Identity(
      {@required this.uid, @required this.token, @required this.refreshToken});

  Identity.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json)
      : uid = json['uid'],
        token = json['token'],
        refreshToken = json['refreshToken'];

  Identity.empty()
      : uid = null,
        token = null,
        refreshToken = null;

  bool isEmpty() => uid == null;

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() =>
      {'uid': uid, 'token': token, 'refreshToken': refreshToken};
}
```

Finally, the `IdentityBloc`. Please note that I only expose `identity$` and `setIdentity` as a way to read and write an `Identity`. Also, I will use the BLoC to expose the api for the `IdentityProvider`, which I already covered in the [previous article](https://www.davidanaya.io/2019/test-http-requests-flutter). In this case I only have one method, `create()`, but this could easily be increased.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:meta/meta.dart';
import 'package:app/src/models/identity.dart';
import 'package:app/src/providers/identity_provider.dart';
import 'package:app/src/providers/storage_provider.dart';
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

const String identityStorageId = 'identity';

class IdentityBloc {
  final StorageProvider storage;
  final IdentityProvider _provider;

  final ReplaySubject<Identity> _identity$ = ReplaySubject<Identity>();
  final StreamController<Identity> _setController =
      StreamController<Identity>();

  Stream<Identity> get identity$ => _identity$.stream;

  Sink<Identity> get setIdentity => _setController.sink;

  IdentityBloc(this._provider, {@required this.storage}) {
    _loadFromStorageAndEmit();
    _setController.stream.listen(_saveToStorageAndEmit);
  }

  Future<Identity> createUser() {
    return _provider.create();
  }

  void dispose() {
    _identity$.close();
    _setController.close();
  }

  Future<void> _saveToStorageAndEmit(Identity identity) async {
    try {
      await storage.setMap(identityStorageId, identity.toJson());
      _identity$.add(identity);
    } catch (err) {
      _handleError(err);
    }
  }

  Future<void> _loadFromStorageAndEmit() async {
    try {
      final identityMap = await storage.getMap(identityStorageId);
      // even if it's null, we need to emit the value for initial navigation
      final identity = identityMap != null
          ? Identity.fromJson(identityMap)
          : Identity.empty();
      _identity$.add(identity);
    } catch (err) {
      _handleError(err);
    }
  }

  void _handleError(dynamic err) {
    // log the error, retry or use any other strategy
  }
}
```

Note that on the constructor I do two important things:

- Read from storage and emit the value read, or an empty `Identity` if none is found.
- Subscribe to my own `_setController`, which is used by `setIdentity`, so that when a new `Identity` is set, I save it to the storage and emit a new value in `identity$`.

## Test cases

We want to focus only in our BLoC, and in particular in the three following use cases:

- On creation, with a valid `Identity` in storage, `identity$` emits a new value with the data read.
- On creation, with no `Identity` in storage, `identity$` emits an empty `Identity`.
- When a new `Identity` is set, this is saved to storage and it’s also emitted by `identity$`.

We could test more uses cases, but for now I think these three cover the initial requirements for our BLoC.

## Mocking and faking

As usual with unit testing we are only interested in our _sut_ (Subject Under Test) which in this case is `IdentityBloc`, but since this has a dependency on `IdentityProvider` and `StorageProvider`, we need to mock those ones.

Again we will be using [mockito](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito) to easily create the mocks we need. Just extending `Mock` (provided by [mockito](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito)) and implementing the class we want to mock we will have a new class with mocked implementations for all the methods that we might need.

With that we can create our `identity_bloc_test.dart` file and set our test bed.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';
import 'package:app/src/blocs/identity_bloc.dart';
import 'package:app/src/models/identity.dart';
import 'package:app/src/providers/identity_provider.dart';
import 'package:app/src/providers/storage_provider.dart';

// buildTestEnvironment()
import '../../config.dart';

class MockIdentityProvider extends Mock implements IdentityProvider {}

class MockStorageProvider extends Mock implements StorageProvider {}

void main() {
  MockIdentityProvider provider;
  MockStorageProvider storage;
  IdentityBloc sut;

  final identity = Identity(uid: "123", token: "123abc", refreshToken: "abba");

  setUp(() {
    // used to provide environment variables for my test
    buildTestEnvironment();
    provider = MockIdentityProvider();
    storage = MockStorageProvider();
  });

  tearDown(() {
    clearInteractions(storage);
    sut = null;
    storage = null;
    provider = null;
  });

  test(
      'on creation storage is read and an identity\$ emits an event with data read',
      () {
  });

  test('on creation identity\$ emits an empty event if no data in storage',
      () {
  });

  test('setIdentity saves data in storage and emits new value in identity\$',
      () {
  });
}
```

## Helper functions

We need some extra work for `MockStorageProvider` thought, because part of the functionality we want to test for `IdentityBloc` depends on this class returning what we need. With the default implementation that we get by [mockito](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mockito) all the methods used (`setMap()` and `getMap()`) will be mocked, but they will return `null`, which is not what we want. We actually need them to return a `Future` with the value read for `getMap()` and a truthy value if it was successfully saved for `setMap()`. We need to stub these two methods.

```dart
void main() {
  ...
  void stubSetMap(dynamic value) {
    when(storage.setMap(identityStorageId, any))
        .thenAnswer((_) => Future.value(true));
  }

  void stubGetMap(dynamic value) {
    when(storage.getMap(identityStorageId))
        .thenAnswer((_) => Future.value(value));
  }
  ...
}
```

## Test an existing Identity is read and emitted on initialization

```dart
  test(
      'on creation storage is read and an identity\$ emits an event with data read',
      () async {
    final expected = identity;

    stubGetMap(identity.toJson());

    sut = IdentityBloc(provider, storage: storage);
    expect(sut.identity$, emits(expected));
  });
```

We spy our `getMap()` method and make sure that when called it will return our fake `Identity`. Then we instantiate `IdentityBloc` with our mocked classes and expect `sut.identity$` to emit the value returned by our mocked storage.

## Test an empty Identity is emitted on initialization if there’s none stored

```dart
  test('on creation identity\$ emits an empty event if no data in storage',
      () async {
    final expected = Identity.empty();

    stubGetMap(null);

    sut = IdentityBloc(provider, storage: storage);
    expect(sut.identity$, emits(expected));
  });
```

Same idea, but in this case our expected _Identity_ is an empty one.

## Test an identity set is saved into storage and also emitted

```dart
  test('setIdentity saves data in storage and emits new value in identity\$',
      () async {
    final expected = identity;

    stubGetMap(null);
    stubSetMap(true);

    sut = IdentityBloc(provider, storage: storage);
    sut.setIdentity.add(identity);

    // as setIdentity is async, we need to wait until it's called to verify storage.setMap was actually called
    await untilCalled(storage.setMap(identityStorageId, any));
    verify(storage.setMap(identityStorageId, any)).called(1);

    expect(sut.identity$, emitsInOrder([Identity.empty(), expected]));
  });
```

This is the most complex case, but we can follow the same idea. We set our stubs and then initialize `IdentityBloc` and set the `Identity` with `setIdentity.add()`.

We then need to verify that `setMap()` was called, but since `setIdentity` is asynchronous we need to wait for it.

Then we also need to verify that `identity$` emitted two values, first an empty `Identity` (as our `getMap()` returned `null`) and then the proper identity that we set previously.

## All working, right? Well… not really

Actually, if we run the tests like this, none of them will pass. Instead we will get an error like this:

```
Expected: <Instance of ‘Identity’>
Actual: <Instance of ‘Identity’>
```

What this means is that the instance of the `Identity` that we expect is not the same that we receive. This makes sense, because in all of our tests the instance that we get is created with `Identity.empty()` or with `Identity.fromJson()`, so even if the contents of the instance are the same as our faked identity, both instances are different.

In order to fix this we need to implement the operator `==` in our `Identity` model. That way, when two instances of `Identity` are compared for equality (as it is done in our `expect()` clause in all tests), this operator implementation will be used.

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';
import 'package:quiver/core.dart' show hash3;

class Identity {
  final String token;
  final String refreshToken;
  final String uid;

  Identity(
      {@required this.uid, @required this.token, @required this.refreshToken});

  Identity.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json)
      : uid = json['uid'],
        token = json['token'],
        refreshToken = json['refreshToken'];

  Identity.empty()
      : uid = null,
        token = null,
        refreshToken = null;

  bool isEmpty() => uid == null;

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() =>
      {'uid': uid, 'token': token, 'refreshToken': refreshToken};

  // override operator == to allow for equal comparisons in tests
  @override
  bool operator ==(other) {
    if (other is! Identity) {
      return false;
    }

    if (uid != other.uid) {
      return false;
    }
    if (token != other.token) {
      return false;
    }
    if (refreshToken != other.refreshToken) {
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  @override
  int get hashCode => hash3(uid, token, refreshToken);
}
```

The `==` operator method is where we implement the equality logic. In our case, we require that all the `uid`, `token` and `refreshToken` are the same for two instances to be equal.

Regarding the getter `hashCode`, [it’s recommended for consistency](http://pchalin.blogspot.com/2014/04/defining-equality-and-hashcode-for-dart.html) that whenever you override the `==` operator, you also do that with `hashCode`, otherwise you could have two instances being considered equal but having a different hashCode, which could cause some problems if you were used some Map or indexed data structure based on hashed keys.

## Now we are done

Now this will work properly. I focused only in a very limited set of functionality, but you could expand your tests using the same approach.

That’s all. Feel free to post any question in the comments. Thanks for reading!
